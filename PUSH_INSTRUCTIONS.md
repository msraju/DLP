# Push to GitHub

I have already configured the remote repository for you:
`https://github.com/msraju/DLP.git`

To finish uploading, simply run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

You will likely be asked to sign in to GitHub. Check for a pop-up window or enter your Personal Access Token in the terminal.
